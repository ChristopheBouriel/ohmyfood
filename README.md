# About this repo :

This was a project for my Junior Web Developper training, consisting in a simple user interface.  
It mainly had to strictly reproduce the model while being perfectly responsive and having the CSS animations requested.

Since I used Yeoman and its workflow which comes with gulp as a task runner, among other things we have a local web server with a fast live reload, and the command above call "gulp serve" to launch this one.  
A new tab will automatically open in your browser, or you can find it at localhost:9000
